Triangle Counter
================

This program simply counts triangles that the user
inputs. To compile and use on your own, install SDL2.

This repository is just to host my code online. I 
made this program to write a blog about on my website.

The blog post is not there yet due to the program not
being completed. I waited a bit to make a repo since
I did not know I was going to go through with this.

Once the program is complete, I will have a page on
my website explaining the whole thing.
